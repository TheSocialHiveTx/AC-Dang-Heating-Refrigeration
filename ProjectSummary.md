# Project Summary: AC Dang Heating & Refrigeration

This project is a high-converting, mobile-first lead-generation website designed specifically for **AC Dang Heating & Refrigeration**, a trusted HVAC contractor serving the Houston, TX metropolitan area. 

### Core Objectives:
- **Phone-First Conversion:** The layout prioritizes click-to-call interactions through a persistent sticky mobile bar and prominent "Call Now" buttons across all sections.
- **Trust-Driven Authority:** Emphasizes 20+ years of experience (since 1997) and verified customer testimonials highlighting "honest diagnostics" and "upfront pricing" to combat industry skepticism.
- **Urgency & Relevance:** Directly addresses the "extreme Texas heat" pain point with messaging focused on fast response and emergency availability.
- **Service Breadth:** Clearly delineates core services including residential AC Repair, Installation, Heating, and specialized Light Commercial Refrigeration.
- **SEO Ready:** Follows a static-site friendly structure optimized for local Houston searches, featuring service area coverage and clear NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency.

The site uses a professional color palette of deep slates, cool blues, and urgent reds to represent the balance of climate control expertise.
