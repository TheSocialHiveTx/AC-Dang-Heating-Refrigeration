# Visual Effects & UI Notes

### 1. Sticky Mobile Call Bar
- **Interaction:** Fixed to the viewport bottom on mobile devices (< 768px).
- **Visuals:** High-contrast background (Blue-600) with a prominent white button. Includes a "pulse" effect or subtle shadow to separate from background content.

### 2. Above-the-Fold Trust Signals
- **Layout:** Immediate visual confirmation of 20+ years experience via a "Since 1997" badge.
- **Reviews:** Rating stars (yellow-400) placed near the primary CTA to reduce friction.

### 3. Subtle Gradients & Dividers
- **Technique:** Use of slate-900 with blue/red blurred glow blobs to create depth without using heavy image assets.
- **Section Dividers:** Clean, light border-b lines (slate-100) to maintain a modern, uncluttered feel.

### 4. Hover-Lift Service Cards
- **Interaction:** On desktop, service cards scale slightly (1.02x) and drop a deeper shadow on hover to indicate interactivity.
- **Micro-interaction:** Icons change color or animate slightly to draw the eye.

### 5. Typography & Hierarchy
- **Primary Font:** Inter (Sans-serif) for high legibility on small screens.
- **Scale:** Extra-large bold headings for mobile scanning. Small, uppercase tracking-widest subheads for category labels.
- **Contrast:** High contrast (White on Slate-900, Slate-900 on White) to ensure WCAG accessibility compliance.

### 6. Scroll-Reveal Credits
- **Credibility:** As users scroll into the "Why Choose Us" section, checkmarks or icons should appear to "pop" into place, reinforcing trust signals progressively.
